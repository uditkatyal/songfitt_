# songfitt_
SONGFITT is a online Robust Music Recommendation Engine where in you can finds the best songs that suits your taste.

Along with the rapid expansion of digital music formats, managing and searching for songs has become signiÔ¨Åcant. The purpose of this project is to build a recommendation system to allow users to discover music based on their listening preferences. Therefore in this model I focused on the public opinion to discover and recommend music.

## Installation

Use pip to install the requirements.

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Usage

To run the web server, simply execute streamlit with the app.py file:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

##  Proposed methodology 
  In this Project I have used K Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithms.
  The model is initially trained with dataset provided and then recommends the songs as per user input.

- Music Trend Analysis (by location) - https://www.kaggle.com/code/hkapoor/music-trends-analysis-by-location/data

## Data cleaning and pre-processing:
- read playlists/track info from json files
- extract audio features for each track
- optimise the features
